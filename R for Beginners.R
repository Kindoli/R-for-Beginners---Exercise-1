## Exercise 1

## In this exercise, you will practice doing exploratory data analysis and plotting in R.


## -----------------------------------------------------------

## 1. First, load the R package you will use in this exercise.
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)

## Read in the Excel file called "Titanic dataset", and assign it to a dataset called "data.1". 
## Hint: make sure you know what folder the file is saved in on your computer, and make sure you set your working directory to that folder.




## 2. convert the variables into dates and factors. This will make downstream analyses easier:


## 3. How many rows (observations) are in this dataset?




## 4. How many columns (variables) are in this dataset?



## 5. What are the names of the columns in this dataset?



## 6. What is the value in Row 3, Column 4?




## 7. What is the value in Row 4, Column 3?




## 8. What are the oldest and youngest passengers included in this data set?
## Hint: Get a summary of the "Age" variable.





## 9. What is the mean age of participants included in this data set?



## 10. Make a histogram of the ages of participants included in this data set.
## Save this figure as a .png file called "hist_ageyrs".



## 11. How many male and female are in the dataset ("sex")?





## 12. How many Passengers were reported as survived? How many Passengers never survived?





## 13. How many Passengers who survived were in first class ("Pclass")?





## 14. Make a frequency (contigency) table of the Survived and Pclass variables. What do each of the three values in this table mean?





## 15. Make a scatterplot of ageyrs against Fare, with the points as filled circles representing sex 
# Save this scatterplot as a .pdf file called "scatter".
